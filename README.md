Hi 👋 Zekun Lou here.

- 🏃‍ Currently working on ML applications in material science.
  - 🔬 To be precise, I'm working on designing descriptors of condensed matters for material reversed designing.
  - 🔧 I do most of my work with Python and PyTorch.
  - ➕ Plus, I'm also interested in Wolfram Mathematica.
- 🙄 I'm still learning the basis of ML.
  - 🤔 Because I major in Physics rather than CS.
